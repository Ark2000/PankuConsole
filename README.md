For more detailed information, please visit [Installing plugins](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html)

# ü§îHow does it work?

1. Enable this plugin, it will add an autoload singleton which named `Panku` in your project.
2. Run any scene, press `~` key, and the console window will pop up. (The key can be changed in the script)
3. The console window explanation:

   1. The title, drag this to move the window around.
   2. Exit button, click to close the window.
   3. Env options, use `Panku.register_env()` to add more envs.
   4. Input field, press enter to submit, up/down to navigate history input.
   5. Resize button, drag this to resize the window.

4. Try to type 'abs(cos(PI))', you will see the result `1`.

5. Now, try to type `help` and you will get some basic hints.

    How is this implemented? Well, it's EXTREMELY easy, just define a variable or constant like this in the `default_env.gd`, more details will be explained in the next step.
    ```gdscript
    const help = "available methods: say_hi(), enable_in_game_logs(bool), cls()"
    ```
6. The core execution procedure is implemented by `Expression` which is a class that stores an expression you can execute.

    For example, you can add `Panku.regiter_env("player", self)` in the `_ready()` function of your player script. 
    Once it's done, suppose there is a variable called `hp` in your player script, you can type `hp` (The left option button should be `player`) in the console, then you will get the actual value of player's hp. 
    What's more, you can type `set("hp", 100)` to change the value(Note that you can't use `hp=100` since this is not a valid expression).

    For more information about what is `Expression`, please visit [Evaluating expressions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/evaluating_expressions.html)

7. Check `panku.gd` to see what you can do with the global singleton `Panku`

At last, please pay attention that while this plugin is powerful, it's not ready for players since `Expression` is unsafe and exposes lots of internal structure.

A safer command system is being actively developed which can be used by the players, see the Roadmap part below.

# üó∫Roadmap

We're planning to add more features to this plugin in the future, stay tuned!
